# TODO
Some ideas of app features, not all have to be done before the app is considered releasable.

## Homepage
1. Make a scrollable list containing uploaded songs
2. Make a 3d cassette that faces towards the cursors showing the current custom cassette cover (separate from the album cover maybe)
3. make a loading screen to be shown when doing long processes like extracting song metadata and loading data into memory to be shown on list

## Configuration
1. Same as the original cassettify except allow users to change the cover image by clicking the album cover instead of being in the visuals page

## Visuals
1. Easier adjustment for cassette visuals
2. supports non 1:1 images
3. rotation
4. color setting
5. stickers?? (custom images you can add anywhere on the front of the cassette)
6. apply a position setting for a specific image and apply it to every other cassette with the same image (for all currrent and/or future)

## Track
1. Find and program a way to detect BPM
2. Overlay a ticking sound over detected BPM
3. Create a waveform of the song and mark with beat ticks.

## Export
1. Turned into a popup that shows in front of the current page instead of swapping the page
2. Allows the user to export in any format
3. shows a checklist for required things before exporting.

## Settings
1. allows the user to configure certain things like font, dark or lightmode or system, configure what actions the app does automatically like turning off extracting metadata from songs, and then a reset button that wipes all user data stored in the app like cassettes and visuals postion settings.
